# Getting started

iTwin.js is a rich library that enables you to create applications that can visualize, analyze and edit infrastructure digital twins. If you want to find out more about iTwins or iModels, read up here, but we're going to dive right in with our first iTwin.js application.

> You'll need the current LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (18.x as of this writing). We recommend using TypeScript, but it is not required. [More about suggested dev setup](../learning/tutorials/development-prerequesites.md)

## Register a developer account

A Bentley account is required for this app, so head to [developer.bentley.com](https://developer.bentley.com) and sign up or sign in. Once you're all signed in, ---instructions for setting up first itwin, and imodel---

We need it for everything. So I don't see why we don't lean into it.

## Get a Test iTwin and iModel

Unless you have a local copy of an iModel you want to use, you're going to need to

[Click here to create a Test iTwin](https://developer.bentley.com/my-itwins/new/)

Once the Test iTwin is created, create an iModel in the iTwin by clicking the "New" button

## 3. Get, build, and develop code (Web)

[Follow the "Developing a web viewer" tutorial](../learning/tutorials/develop-web-viewer.md)

## 4. Get, build, and develop code (Desktop)

[Follow the "Developing a Desktop Viewer" tutorial](../learning/tutorials/develop-desktop-viewer.md)

Notes:

- If this and the web-viewer tutorial here and the tutorial on developer.bentley.com are all the same, then why do we have this document, or why do we have the setting up a web viewer.
  - In my opinion, ideally, the web-viewer tutorial is moved here, we ditch those â‰ 
- If this is not intended to be a tutorial, then what is it? Is it an introduction to the ecosystem?
